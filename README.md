Messaging and Multiprocessing.

`ezmsg` is a pure-Python implementation of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) pub/sub messaging pattern based on [`labgraph`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/labgraph) which is optimized and intended for use in constructing real-time software. `ezmsg` implements much of the `labgraph` API (with a few notable differences), and owes a lot of its design to the `labgraph` developers/project.

`ezmsg` is very fast and uses Python's `multiprocessing.shared_memory` module to facilitate efficient message passing without C++ or any compilation/build tooling.

## Installation

`pip install ezmsg`

## Dependencies

- Due to reliance on `multiprocessing.shared_memory`, `ezmsg` requires **minimum Python 3.8**.
- `typing_extensions`

Testing `ezmsg` requires:

- `pytest`
- `pytest-cov`
- `pytest-asyncio`
- `numpy`

## Setup (Development)

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install --upgrade pip poetry
(env) $ poetry install --with test

(env) $ python -m pytest tests # Optionally, Perform tests
```

Note that it is generally recommended to install poetry into it's own standalone venv via the `pipx` cli tool.

## Documentation

https://ezmsg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

`ezmsg` is very similar to [`labgraph`](https://www.github.com/facebookresearch/labgraph), so you might get a primer with their documentation and examples. Additionally, there are many examples provided in the examples/tests directories strewn throughout this repository.

## Extensions

`ezmsg` extensions can be installed individually or all at once. To install all the extension packages in one go, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install "ezmsg[all_ext]"
```

This will install all the available public extension packages for `ezmsg` that are listed in `pyproject.toml`.
If you prefer to install the extension packages individually, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install "ezmsg[zmq,sigproc,...]"
```

Please note that the `ezmsg` package itself can still be installed without any additional extensions using `pip install ezmsg`.

See the extension directory for more details

- `ezmsg-sigproc` -- Timeseries signal processing modules
- `ezmsg-websocket` -- Websocket server and client nodes for `ezmsg` graphs
- `ezmsg-zmq` -- ZeroMQ pub and sub nodes for `ezmsg` graphs
- ... More to come!
