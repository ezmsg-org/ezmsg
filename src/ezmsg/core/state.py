    States are mutable dataclasses that are instantiated by the Unit in its home process.

    To track a mutable state for a ``Component``, inherit from ``State``.

    .. code-block:: python

       class YourState(State):
          state1: int
          state2: float

    To use, declare the ``State`` object for a ``Component`` as a member variable called (all-caps!) ``STATE``.
    ``ezmsg`` will monitor the variable called ``STATE`` in the background, so it is important to name it correctly.

    Member functions can then access and mutate ``STATE`` as needed during function execution.
    It is recommended to initialize state values inside the ``initialize()`` or ``configure()`` lifecycle hooks if
    defaults are not defined.

    .. code-block:: python

       class YourUnit(Unit):

          STATE = YourState

          async def initialize(self):
             this.STATE.state1 = 0
             this.STATE.state2 = 0.0

    .. note::
       ``State`` uses type hints to define member variables, but does not enforce type checking.
