    A decorator that primes a generator by advancing it to the first yield statement.

    This is necessary because a generator cannot receive any input through 'send' until
    it has been primed to the point of the first 'yield'. Applying this decorator to a
    generator function ensures that it is immediately ready to accept input.

    Args:
        func: The generator function to be decorated.

    Returns:
        The primed generator ready to accept input.

    Compose a chain of generator functions into a single callable.

    Each generator in the sequence is passed the value from the previous one, starting

    transformations that are applied in sequence when the returned callable is invoked.
