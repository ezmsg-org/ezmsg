How ``ezmsg`` works
===================

When an ``ezmsg`` pipeline is started, ``ezmsg`` initializes two additional processes to manage execution. The first is the ``SharedMemoryServer``, which allocates blocks of memory to nodes. The second is the ``GraphServer``, which creates edges between each node and sends them appropriate shared memory addresses. One ``GraphServer`` should be initialized per ``ezmsg`` pipeline, and one ``SharedMemoryServer`` should be initialized per machine which the pipeline is running on. Check out the Other page for more information on managing the ``SharedMemoryServer`` and ``GraphServer`` during pipeline execution.
